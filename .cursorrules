# Cursor rules
- Use Clean Architecture. Domain is framework-free.
- Pydantic only at boundaries (DTOs and LLM validation).
- Azure OpenAI with strict JSON schema (response_format.json_schema, strict=true).
- Exact folder layout and filenames as provided.
- No hot reload of definitions; load once at startup from Azure Blob.
- API contracts must match exactly as specified.
- Always use Pydantic latest version
- No need of backward compatibility as it is assumed that the version you are creating is the first release.
