# Title:
[Analysis] High-Level API and Software Architecture Design

## Status/metadata:
Open — Issue created today

## [Business Summary]
As an **engineer**  
I want to have a clear understanding of the high-level API and software architecture  
So that I can start implementing the mapper API following clean architecture principles and establish patterns for future API development.

**Placeholder for technical analysis:**
- Design high-level software architecture following Clean Architecture principles
- Define API structure and layering approach
- Establish patterns for Azure integration and LLM orchestration

## [Acceptance Criteria]
- [ ] **Clean Architecture layers** defined (Interface, Application, Domain, Infrastructure)
- [ ] **API contract design** documented with request/response schemas
- [ ] **Domain entities and value objects** identified and modeled
- [ ] **Repository patterns** established for data access abstraction
- [ ] **Dependency injection strategy** designed for testability
- [ ] **Azure service integration** approach defined (OpenAI, Blob Storage)
- [ ] **Error handling and logging** patterns established
- [ ] **Architectural design** documented in Confluence
- [ ] **Technical follow-up stories** for implementation created

## [Expected Work]
- [ ] **Layer structure definition** with clear responsibilities
- [ ] **Domain modeling** for risk themes, taxonomy, and control mappings
- [ ] **API endpoint specification** for mapper functionality
- [ ] **Infrastructure abstraction design** for Azure services
- [ ] **Application service patterns** for business logic orchestration
- [ ] **Testing strategy** aligned with architecture layers

## [Technical Context]
- **Architecture Pattern**: Clean Architecture with domain-driven design
- **Framework**: FastAPI with Pydantic for validation
- **Platform**: Azure (OpenAI, Blob Storage, potential future services)
- **Language**: Python with type hints and strict validation
- **Key Principles**: Framework-free domain, dependency inversion, testability
- **Integration**: Azure OpenAI with JSON schema validation

**Folder Structure**: Organized by architectural layers with clear separation of concerns
