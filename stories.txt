# Title:
[Architecture] Multi-API AI Ecosystem Infrastructure Design

## Status/metadata:
Open — Issue created today

## [Business Summary]
As a **Platform Architect**  
I want to design a scalable multi-API AI ecosystem architecture  
So that we can efficiently support Chat, Mapper, Search, Summarization, and Indexing APIs across multiple applications with shared infrastructure and consistent patterns.

**Placeholder for technical analysis:**
- Design enterprise-grade AI ecosystem supporting multiple domain-specific APIs
- Establish shared infrastructure for LLM orchestration, security, and observability
- Create reusable patterns while maintaining API autonomy

## [Acceptance Criteria]
- [ ] **Architecture diagram** showing all layers (Gateway, Shared Services, Orchestration, APIs, Data)
- [ ] **Clean Architecture principles** maintained across all APIs
- [ ] **Shared domain layer** defined for cross-API concepts (User, TokenUsage, TraceContext)
- [ ] **API-specific domains** preserved for specialized business logic
- [ ] **Infrastructure design** for Azure services (API Management, OpenAI, Search, Blob)
- [ ] **Security model** with authentication, authorization, and tenant isolation
- [ ] **Observability strategy** with monitoring, logging, and analytics
- [ ] **DevOps approach** for multi-API deployment and governance
- [ ] **Technical documentation** created in Confluence
- [ ] **Implementation roadmap** with phases and dependencies identified

## [Expected Work]
- [ ] **Multi-API ecosystem design** with shared infrastructure
- [ ] **Individual API architecture** (Chat, Mapper, Search, Summary, Indexing)
- [ ] **Shared services specification** (LLM Orchestrator, Embedding Service, Cache)
- [ ] **Data architecture** for storage, vectors, and analytics
- [ ] **Security and compliance framework** design
- [ ] **Implementation phases** and migration strategy
- [ ] **Technical follow-up stories** created for each API and shared component

## [Technical Context]
- **Base**: Extend existing Mapper API Clean Architecture
- **Pattern**: Domain-driven design with shared infrastructure
- **Platform**: Azure cloud services (API Management, OpenAI, Search, Cosmos DB)
- **APIs**: Chat, Mapper, Semantic Search, Summarization, Indexing
- **Shared Components**: LLM Orchestrator, Embedding Service, Security, Observability
- **Architecture Style**: Microservices with shared platform services
- **Deployment**: Container-based with Azure DevOps CI/CD

**API Structure**: Each API maintains Interface → Application → Domain → Infrastructure layers with shared components for cross-cutting concerns
